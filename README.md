# Student Management System (CSV-Based)

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to develop a console-based application to manage student records efficiently using Python. It focuses on **File Handling** and **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to ensure that student data is persistently stored in a CSV file (`students.csv`) rather than being lost when the program ends.

## Features
* **Add Student:** Add new records with validation (Unique ID, Valid Email).
* **Search Student:** Quickly find student details using their ID.
* **View All:** Display a formatted list of all registered students.
* **Delete Student:** Remove a student record permanently from the file.
* **Data Persistence:** Automatically saves all changes to `students.csv`.

## How to Run the Script
1.  Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2.  Download the `student_manager.py` file.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder containing the file.
4.  Run the command:
    ```bash
    python student_manager.py
    ```
5.  Follow the on-screen menu instructions.
